Below is a JSON-formatted dictionary. Use the "notes" field in the JSON dictionary, which is a nested JSON dictionary. The keys in "notes" represent individual instruments, and the values is a JSON list representing all of the notes played by that instrument in the music clip. 
Each element in the value JSON list represents one note played in the music, and includes the following keys:
- start: the start time of the note, in seconds
- end: the end time of the note, in seconds
- pitch: the pitch and octave of the note

In addition to these fields, the JSON also contains the following special annotations:
- tempo_in_beats_per_minute_madmom: the tempo of the track in beats per minute (BPM).
- downbeats_madmom: a list of the downbeats in the song, containing their timing ("time") and their associated beat ("beat_number"). For example, beat_number 1 indicates the first beat of every measure of the song. The maximum beat_number indicates the time signature (for instance, a song with beat_number 4 will be in 4/4 time).
- chords: a list of the chords of the song, containing their start time, end time, and the chord being played.
- key: the key of the song.

Only use "notes" field.
